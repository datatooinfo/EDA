The goal is to examine how household energy varies over a two day period in February, 2007. Four plots are constructed using the base plotting system. 
Each plot has been saved to a PNG file , width=480 and height=480. The plots are named plot1.png through plot4.png. There are four corresponding R scripts named plot1.R through plot4.R.
